# Keymaker

* _Are you tired of always using the same short passwords for everything?_

* _Is your human brain unable to remember a mere list of arrays with pseudo-random combinations of fewer than four characters?_

* _Is that new fancy website you tried to log on to complaining that your password is too short again?_

If you are familiar with any of these situations, I may have a solution for you!

Behold, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to introduce the Keymaker, a program that takes your easily memorable human-like password and transforms it into a longer, more complex, and non-human-like password that you can use wherever you wish, always under your responsibility =)

## What You Will Find Here

The Keymaker program facilitates the generation of strong passwords, even if you still want to keep using your easily memorable ones. The Keymaker contains a MasterKey that you can customize to ensure that all your generated new passwords will be unique and known only by you.

To sum up, the program works using three main parts:

- **MasterKey:** The master key is an arbitrarily long phrase or small text that you can customize as you wish. The MasterKey is the most crucial part of the program. You can store it in a file or set it manually.
- **The Lock:** Here, you input your short human-based password.
- **The Key:** The new unique password that the Keymaker will generate from your Lock and the MasterKey. This newly generated password will contain 21 characters formed by a non-human-based and hard-to-break combination of letters, capitals, numbers, and the two special characters _ and $.

### Example

- **MasterKey:** `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.`
- **Lock:** `Password123`
- **Key:** `XlXyuAe8YQrN1y53Y8$c`

> Look at that combination of 21 characters!!!
