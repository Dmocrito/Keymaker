# Keymaker

* *Are you tired to use always the same short passwords for everything?*

* *Is your meaty human brain unable to remembering a mere list of arrays with pseudo-aleatory combinations of less than two dozens of characters?*

* *Is that new fancy website that you tried to log on complaining that yours is too short again?*

Well, if you are familiar with some of these situations, I may have a solution for you!

Behold Ladies and Gentlemen, here I'm glad to introduce the *Keymaker*, a program that takes your human-like easy-to-memorize password and transforms it into a longer, harder and non-human-like password that you can use whatever you wish, always under your responsibility ;b


## What you will find here
The *Keymaker* is a program that facilitates the generation of strong passwords, even if you still want to keep using your easy-to-memorize ones. The *Keymaker* contains a *MasterKey* that you can customize to guarantee that all your generated new passwords will be unique and only known by you.

To sum up, the program works using three main parts:

* **MasterKey** The master key is an arbitrarily long-phrase or small text that you can customize as you wish. The *MasterKey* is the most crucial part of the program. You can store it in a file or set it manually.
* **The Lock** Here, you put your short human-based password.
* **The Key** The new unique password that the Keymaker will generate from your *Lock* and the *MasterKey*. This newly generated password will contain 21 characters formed by a non-human-based and hard-to-broke combination of letters, capitals, numbers, and the two special characters  _ and $.

### Example


   · *MasterKey:* `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.`

   · *Lock:* `Password123`

   · **Key:** `XlXyuAe8YQrN1y53Y8$c`

> Look at that combination of 21 characters!
